# **Bio**
Hi! My name is Lauren and I am new to Earth Data Science! I am passionate about historic preservation and architectural history and would love to somehow involve that knowledge into what I will accomplish in the certificate course. I am also an avid baker (at high altitude), breads, cakes, pastries, cookies, pretty much anything you can think of. While baking and historic preservation may seem unrelated to Earth Data Science, they can relate by being very intricate and detailed in nature.

## Great Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba

"Dating to the 8th century, the Great Mosque of Córdoba is an example of Umayyad sacred architecture in what is current Spain. While this structure had its formations in the 780’s C.E., it expanded over the next two centuries eventually doubling from its original size. Like other mosques and Islamic architecture from the period of Islamic rule in Spain, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was transformed by later ruling Catholic Spaniards. Despite these transformations, the Great Mosque of Cordoba remains significant to Islamic art and architecture through its decorative tradition and the architectural features that attribute to the sacredness of the building..."

This map shows the outline of the Great Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba as is exists today, after it's earlier expansions.The Great Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba is situated in Spain's southern most region, Andalucía, just north of the Guadalquivir River. It is also part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site - please read more about it if interested.

## Questions:  
### * What I'm Excited About Learning About Earth Data Science
I am excited to learn how to use different tools and types of data to work on projects and be proficient enough to start a career in this.

### * Questions I'd like to Answer Using Earth Data Science
* What can Earth Data Science tell us about historic preservation efforts? There are frequesnt issues with structural stability in part due to deffered maintenance, but also due to changes in the earth upon which structures sit, and climate change increasing flooding or fire potential to historic structures and places. One of the largest problems I see are front porches sinking and or pulling off the face of the front facade. Another issue I see is foundation/ structural issues with masonry due to moisture (and lack of maintenace).
* How can Earth Data Science merge with other discplines/ industries to share new insights?
